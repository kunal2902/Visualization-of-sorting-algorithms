Visualization of sorting algorithms

1.Visualization of Different Sorting Algorithms on a large Data set in graphical display
2.Recurrrence relation and Time Complexity of the Selected Algorithms to give a precise view to the user
3.SImple Direct MediaLayer Library is used to provide access.
4. Sorting Algorithms
Implementation of Common Algorithms:
Bubble Sort: Visualize the process of comparing and swapping adjacent elements.
Selection Sort: Show the selection of the smallest/largest element and its placement in the sorted portion.
Insertion Sort: Illustrate the insertion of elements into their correct position in the sorted portion.
Merge Sort: Split the array and merge them back together while sorting.
Quick Sort: Highlight the pivot selection, partitioning, and recursive sorting of subarrays.
Heap Sort: Demonstrate the process of building a heap and sorting it.
5. Educational Features
Algorithm Descriptions: Include brief descriptions and explanations of each sorting algorithm.
Complexity Analysis: Display the time and space complexity of each algorithm (e.g., O(n^2), O(n log n)).
6. Performance Optimization
Efficient Rendering: Optimize the rendering loop to handle large arrays without significant lag.
Resource Management: Properly manage SDL resources (textures, renderers, windows) to avoid memory leaks and ensure smooth performance.
